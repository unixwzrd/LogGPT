Here's another fun message to see if you can figure it out. Or of some obscure reference, on Pink Floyds's Dark Side of The Moon, and onwards, they made their albums into loops where the fade out to the end if part of the fade-in. Dark side began with the heartbeat and the old man talking about life death, and sanity. The Wall had this very faint music abruptly start ah the beginning, and at the end of the last track you hear the same very faint music playing. if you listen carefully at the end you hear, \"Isn't this where\", then it abruptly stops.  At the beginning with the faint music, you can loop it because you hear the same voice from the end saying when the music abruptly starts, \"we came in?\" making the album come complete circle.  They loved to put easter eggs in their albums, I found many hidden messages on their albums like another on \"The Wall\" album which has backwards masking that said, \"Congratulations, you have discovered the secret message. Send your letters to Old Pink, care of Cauldrich funny farm.\" If I'm not mistaken Cauldrich is the place they had Syd Barrett committed. Fun facts...
