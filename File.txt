Here's another fun message to see if you can figure it out. Or cof some obscure reference, on Pink Floyds's Dark Side of The Moon, and onwards, they made their albums into loops wheer the fade out to the end if part of the fade-in. Dark side began with the heartbeat and the old man talkng abou life death, and sanity. The Wall had this very faint misic abruptly start ath ethe beginning,m and at the end of the last track you hear the same very faint music playing. if you listen carefuklly at the end you hear, \"Isn't this where\", then it sbruptly stops.  At the beginning with the faint music, you can loop it because you hear the same voice from the end saying whenthe music abruptly starts, \"we came in?\" making the album come complete circle.  They loved to put easter eggs in their albums, I found menay hidden messages on theor albums like another on The Wall\" album whci hwas backwards masking tahat said, \"Congratulations, you habve discovered the secret message. Send your letters to Cauldrich funny farm.\" If I'm nopt misteken Cauldrich is the place they had Syd Barrett comitted. Fun facts...
